# Bona

Restarted from scratch

(Development will resume April 2019)

Deep learning image processing application for medical diagnosis.

(An experiment into mobile and embedded “classification” machine learning utilizing Google’s TensorFlow Lite framework, mainly for learning purposes.)

Bona is a project targeted to users in 3rd world countries who have little to no access to local physicians. Many potential users’ own smartphones because they give them a means communication to family via cellular towers and VOIP. These smart phones are pocket-sized super computers that possess the sensor technology required to generate relevant data for machine learning models. Although still in the planning phase, there are 3 main goals of this project:

1.	Give each user the power to proactively identify and potentially diagnose their condition.
2.	Provide doctors with a better pool of patient data to aid with the diagnosis process by aggregating user submissions and queries.
3.	Detect and potentially predict user illnesses to save lives.
