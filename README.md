# Bona

(Development will resume August 2018)

Deep learning image processing application for medical diagnosis.

Bona is a project intended for users in 3rd world countries who have little to no access to local physicians. Many potential users own smartphones because they give them a means to communicate with family via VOIP. These smart phones are pocket-sized super computers that possess all the sensors and tools to utilize machine learning on.  Although still in the planning phase, there are 3 main goals of this project:

1.	Give each user the power to proactively identify and potentially diagnose their injuries or conditions.
2.	Provide doctors with a better pool of patient data to aid with the diagnosis process by aggregating user submission and queries.
3.	Detect and potentially predict user illnesses to save lives.
